HOW TO RUN THIS CODE

    by: m.thiesse@sheffield.ac.uk

## Step 1:

Create a definition for the dataset you wish to sample from
e.g. $ samweb -e dune create-definition <your-definition-name> "<various-things-you-can-learn-by-reading-the-help-documentation-for-samweb-and/or-ifdh>"
 
  (Definitions live forever until explicitly deleted)

## Step 2:

Start a samweb "project", to which you attach a definition.

  (Projects live forever and cannot be deleted, so create a UNIQUE name! Names with username and date/time, are good places to start.)

e.g. $ samweb -e dune start-project --defname=<definition-name-from-above> <unique-project-name>

## Step 3:

Tell your LArSoft code which project and which definition you want to attach. In the case of OverlayRawDigits, these are in fhicl parameters.

## Step 4: 

Run your grid OR interactive job. SAM should do the work of choosing which files to read, and where they are located, so you don't have to.


####### These steps are simplified in the script init_sam.sh. 
####### Use at your own risk 


####### TROUBLESHOOTING #######

You must be a member of the SAM group "dune" for this to work. Check with 
  $ samweb describe-user <your-username>
